# Incident-Handler-Journal
In this project, I simulate reviewing the details of a security incident and document the incident using my incident handler's journal - one of the most important documents in the incident response process

### Skills Learned

- **Incident Documentation:** Gained experience in thoroughly documenting a cybersecurity incident, ensuring all details are recorded systematically.
- **Incident Analysis:** Developed skills in analyzing the sequence of events to understand methods used by attackers.
- **Communication:** Improved ability to communicate incident details and responses to various stakeholders.
- **Response Planning:** Developed a structured and systematic approach towards responding to cybersecurity incidents. 
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations:** Gained awareness of the ethical and legal implications of actions taken during and after a cybersecurity attack, for example, ransom payments during a ransomware attack.

### Tools Used

- **Incident Handler's Journal.**

## Scenario 1 - Ransomware Attack
_A small U.S. healthcare clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.__

_Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. 
In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key._

_The attackers were able to gain access to the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded._

_Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance._

| **Who:**                                      | An organized group of malicious hackers   |
| **What:**                                     | A ransomware security incident            |
| **Where:**                                    | At a health care company                  |
| **When:**                                     | Tuesday morning, 9:00 a.m.                         |
| **Why:**                                      | The incident happened because unethical hackers were able to access the company's systems using a phishing attack. After gaining access the attackers launched their ransomware on the company's systems encrypting critical files. The attackers' motivation appears to be financial because the ransom note they left demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.  |

| **How the Incident Unfolded:**                | Several employees reported being unable to access files around 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday. They discovered a ransom note on their screens, indicating their files were encrypted. The attackers used targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments to infiltrate the network. Once inside, they deployed the ransomware to encrypt critical files, disrupting business operations and patient care. |
| **Immediate Actions Taken:**                  | The company shut down its computer systems to prevent further damage and contacted cybersecurity experts for assistance. They also reported the incident to relevant authorities and organizations. |
| **Impact on Business Operations:**            | The inability to access critical patient data forced the clinic to halt operations, affecting patient care and causing significant operational disruptions. |
| **Communication with Stakeholders:**          | The company informed employees, patients, and partners about the incident and the steps being taken to address it. |
| **Investigation Findings:**                   | Initial investigations confirmed that the phishing emails were the entry point. The attackers had likely studied the organization to craft convincing emails targeting specific employees. |

| **Recommendations**   |                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Employee Training:**                        | Implement regular cybersecurity awareness training to educate employees about phishing attacks and how to recognize them. |
| **Email Security:**                           | Deploy advanced email filtering solutions to detect and block malicious emails. |
| **Endpoint Protection:**                      | Install and maintain robust endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware execution. |
| **Backup and Recovery:**                      | Ensure regular backups of critical data are conducted and stored securely offline. Test backup restoration procedures periodically. |
| **Incident Response Plan:**                   | Develop and regularly update an incident response plan that includes procedures for handling ransomware attacks. |
| **Access Controls:**                          | Implement strict access controls and monitor network traffic to detect and prevent unauthorized access. |
| **Patching and Updates:**                     | Ensure all systems and software are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. |

| **Considerations regarding the Ransomware Attack**   |                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Risk of Non-Retrieval:**                    | Paying the ransom does not guarantee the attackers will provide the decryption key. |
| **Funding Criminal Activities:**              | Paying the ransom could encourage further criminal activities and fund other illegal operations. |
| **Legal and Ethical Implications:**           | There may be legal and ethical considerations regarding ransom payment. Consult legal counsel before deciding. |
| **Alternative Solutions:**                    | Focus on restoring systems from backups and using cybersecurity experts to decrypt files without paying the ransom. |

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the critical need for proactive cybersecurity measures, including employee training, robust email security, and comprehensive incident response planning. The company should invest in preventive strategies to mitigate the risk of future attacks and ensure business continuity in the event of similar incidents. Paying the ransom is not recommended due to the uncertainties and potential negative consequences. Instead, the company should focus on improving its cybersecurity posture and recovery capabilities.
